# Project Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple project management system built with React. Primary goal of this project was to practise and reinforce the React fundamental concepts I have learnt. The emphasis was on deeper understanding and implementing these concepts rather than achieving perfect structure and styling. 

## Purpose
Practise:
* Components
* JSX 
* State managament
* Hooks
* Refs
* Portals 
* Lifting the state up 
* Props 
* Updating reference values
* Dynamic Styling
* Forms Handling


## Features
* Task Management: create, moving between sections (To-Do, In-Progress, Done), delete
* Project Management: create, details overview, delete

## Instalation
To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Pawko23/Project-Management.git```
2. Navigate to project directory:
```cd project-man```
3. Install dependencies:
```npm install```
4. Start the development server:
```npm run dev```

## Notes
* Due to the educational purpose of the project, structure and styling may not be the best
* Currently the application stores project's informations in the browser's localStorage. Project will be connected to database and maybe even expanded for board sharing in the future
